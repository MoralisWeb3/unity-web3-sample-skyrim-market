# 🎮 Web3 Skyrim Market 🎮

Unity sample project where you can trade in-game currency (PlayFab) for ERC-20 tokens. Only with that tokens you can then buy NFT Outfits which you can actually wear!

In this project we're marrying Web2 and Web3. We're using PlayFab as a backend for in-game currency and displaying items in stores. Then we add the power of Web3 through Moralis to convert these Web2 items to actual NFTs :)
